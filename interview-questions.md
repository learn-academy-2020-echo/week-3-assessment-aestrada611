# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Destructuring is a way shorter way to access different values from objects.

  Researched answer: It is a syntax expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct new variables. This allows for code to be much more concise and readable.



2. What are React lifecycle methods? Provide three examples.

  Your answer: There are three main phases to react component's lifecycle which are mounting, updating, and unmounting.

  Researched answer: For mounting React has four built in methods and the one that is called before everything else is called the constructor and is where initial state is set. Render is always required and is what will actually be rendered on the page. For updating there are other methods but render is always required. There is only one unmounting method which is componentWillUnmount



3.//// What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I know that they have different ways to write them out and objects are enclosed in bracket parenthesis.

  Researched answer: The main difference between the two is how they are written out and class declarations are not hoisted. A class also defines object properties and can also describe object behavior.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: A div encloses everything within the div tags while a span tag is used within to wrap less text.

  Researched answer: A div is a block level element while a span is an inline element that should be used to wrap small portions of text.



5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: They are used to enclose all the pieces of code that are actually going to be rendered onto the page. Only code found between those tags will be read as JSX.

  Researched answer: These tags are used to return elements in React. These tags exist as a workaround to return adjacent JSX elements onto the page.



6. What does it mean to create a responsive web application? What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: A responsive web application is one that has different parts that can render when specified conditions are met.

  Researched answer: A responsive web app is one that has interactivity and has layouts that adjust to fit the screen they are being displayed on. Some options to create responsive design are bootstrap, wirefy, and Invision.



7. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props is the argument that the super and constructor take in order to pass properties to other components.

  Researched answer: Props is a special keyword that has stands for properties and is used in order to send data from a parent component to a child component.



8. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: It is used to delcare state and has to do with scope but other then that I dont really know much more.

  Researched answer: This is mostly used in regards to scope. This refers to the objet when calling a function.



9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

  Your answer: It is like a shortcut for if/else statements.

  Researched answer: If there are only two possible outcomes then it makes a great place to use ternary. A ternary has three parts which are the evaluating condition, a question mark and a semicolon that separates truthy and falsey outcomes.



10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: A type of function that has no name and does not have an argument.

  Researched answer: An anonymous function is one without a name and cannot be invoked again after its creation. They are often used as arguments for other functions.
